# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FUNCTION AND A METHOD AND SCRIPTS
# function: a named block of code that we can't call by name
#       well designed programs generally consists of 
#       several functions that call each
#       -- and keep 'main body' code (not in a function to a minimum)
#       (the easiest function to manage and test is a "pure function":
#       a function that does not refer to outside variables)
#        
#        *argument matching modes*
#
#        positional: each argument is matched to a variable name
#                    in def.
#         
#        variable: an object bound to a name 
#
#        local variable: one that is initialized in a function
#
#         global variable: one that is initialized outside a function
#
#        Keyword:    each argument is optional, and
#                    specifies a default value in def
#
#        variable positional: any number of positional args
#                    can be passed i.e., *args and **kwargs
#                   NOTE: stars 
#
# module: simply, a file with python code
#   script: executable code file
#   module: library code
#
#   the attributes of a module are the global variables of that module's file
#            global var: are name assigned to object and function names
