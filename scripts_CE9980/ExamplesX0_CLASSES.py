## object: an unit of data of a particular type
#         that has characterstic functionality
# 
# rover = Dog()
# 
# rover.bark() #bark! bark!
#
# 'class' statement defiens a new object type

# 'calling' the class produces a new object of that type
#   new object of that type (we call this an 'instance')
#   new objec of that type (we call this an 'instance')
#   (any number of instances can be created)

# each instance has its own "attribute dictionary"
# (setting an attributes updates the dictionary)

# when accessing an attribute, python looks for it
#   in the instance

# if Python can't find the attriubte in the instance
#   if looks for it in the class (i.e., a variable)
#   defined in the class

# the class also has an attribute dictionary
#   these attributes can be accessed in the class itself

# when a method is called on an object, the object is implicitly
#   passed as the frist object

# NOTE: keyboard shortcut used to switch between terminal and vim: 
# ctrl + z ; and f + g (used to returnback)
