Dear Mr. Stanley,



I don't know how to answer your question -- I see no contradiction.


All you have to do is, from time to time -- in spite of everything,

just try to examine a problem in a novel way.




You won't 'Stifle the creative process" if you remember to think

from time to time. Don't you have time to think?
